paragraph1: >-
  No Need to Vanish respectfully acknowledges that we are privileged to live,
  create, and learn on the traditional territory of many nations, including the
  Huron-Wendat, Anishinaabe, Chippewa, Haudenosaunee, Wendat peoples, and most
  recently, the Mississaugas of the Credit First Nation. Today, Tkaronto—meaning
  "where the trees stand in the water"—remains a vital meeting place for many
  diverse First Nations, Inuit, and Métis peoples. We are profoundly grateful to
  be on Turtle Island, a sacred land that has sustained human activity and
  stewardship for over 15,000 years. We honor and extend our deepest respect to
  all First Nations peoples, their ancestors, and future generations.


  We recognize that acknowledging the land is just the beginning, and we are committed to continuing our learning, unlearning, and relationship-building with Indigenous communities. We honor the vibrant traditions of Indigenous music, art, and storytelling that have enriched our collective culture and continue to inspire our work today.
