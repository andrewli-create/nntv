  Canada. A specialist in woodwinds and electronic wind instruments, Stef
  collaborates regularly with artists of diverse genres and musical backgrounds.
  As a music technologist, Stef is best known for customizing his instruments by
  using a Nintendo Wii controller to incorporate gestural MIDI control. His
  innovative and imaginative use of MIDI can be heard on his debut EP,
  Gradualism, as well as in the music that he writes for his modern jazz fusion
  quartet, SHQ. He holds a Bachelorâ€™s of Music  in Contemporary Music

  Hi, I'm Steph Haynes. I'm a performer and producer and composer, working
  primarily in the genre of modern jazz fusion. Music technology is a huge part
  of my work as a performer and a composer.


  When I first started composing with MIDI, I didn't completely understand what it is or how it works. I was doing a lot of my composition in either Sibelius or in Logic Pro, and eventually I discovered that I could export my work from Sibelius as MIDI and open it in Logic. This was awesome for a couple of reasons. For one thing, it was great to hear my work played back on Logic's incredible virtual instruments, but more importantly, I began to explore Logic's MIDI transform functions. Instead of experimenting in Sibelius, I started doing it in Logic because Logic has a different set of MIDI transform functions that are a little bit less geared toward creating sheet music and a little bit more geared toward creative music experimentation.


  Using these functions, I could hear my music transformed in a variety of different ways, such as in reverse or completely flipped upside down. These transformations gave me a different perspective on my music that inspired me to take my music in directions that I hadn't considered before. I also began experimenting with Logic's MIDI effects, such as the arpeggiator, the note repeater, the transposer, and the chord trigger. So I'm a saxophone player first and foremost, so a lot of my compositions are melody first, and sometimes it can be difficult to come up with harmony for these melodies, and a way that I like to do that is I like to use a MIDI device such as a chord trigger or a note repeater that transposes notes in a certain way and helps me come up with harmonies that way. These MIDI effects and MIDI transform functions exist in other DAWs as well, but Logic was the one that I had, so that's the one that I used.


  I find MIDI to be really useful because I can take the same pitch and rhythmic material and run it through different sound libraries or synthesizers and see what works best in my composition. I was working on a project where I recorded a performer playing a keyboard part in MIDI, and then I was able to, in post, change the sound of that instrument to something different. The other thing that I was able to do that worked really well in this composition was I was able to take the pitch information and snap it to a whole new tonality and also run that through an arpeggiator, so that the chords were now a moving line that sounded really interesting in the music. These kinds of manipulations are only possible through the use of MIDI. 


  Use of these MIDI devices has since become a significant part of my composition process because of the way that they can transform my musical ideas into something wholly new, yet still original and true to my artistic vision.
