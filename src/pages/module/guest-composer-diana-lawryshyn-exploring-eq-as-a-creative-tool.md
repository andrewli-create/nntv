biography: Diana Nadia Lawryshyn is a visual and sound artist from Oshawa
  Ontario known for painting on wood surfaces and composing music from field
  recordings. Central to her practice is a willingness to let the environment
  guide her, facilitating an organic expression of what lies dormant in her
  subconscious. Diana holds a Concurrent Education degree from Queen’s
  University and Master of Music from the University of Toronto. Her work has
  received notable recognition, including the City of Oshawa’s Emerging Artist
  award, MusicWorks Magazine’s Maricelle Deschênes Prize, “Best inShow” at the
  Robert McLaughlin Gallery’s Cultural Expressions Juried Art Exhibition, and
  “People’s Choice” at the Station Gallery’s Annual Juried Exhibition.
script: Hi, my name is Diana Lawryshyn. I'm a painter, composer, and a teacher.
  My practice as a composer involves composing electronically, and so this
  involves me using EQ or equalization. It's a great tool. I think it can be
  used for a lot of practical contexts, as well as for things that are creative.
  So my process involves starting off by taking recordings of different things
  in the environment, and these are often very unpredictable sounds. And so EQ
  becomes a really great tool, not just to fix my audio artifacts, but I also
  like to use it creatively to help, you know, make my compositions flow in a
  way that they couldn't otherwise. There was one instance where I was recording
  some water crashing by the waterfront, like waves, and that's a very noisy
  sound. It takes up a large part of the, you know, frequency spectrum. And so
  there was a sound amidst the waves of, like, this bird chirping, and it was
  kind of annoying, and I wanted it out of there, right? And so what I did was I
  went in with the EQ with this sharp kind of bell curve to remove just that one
  frequency, but I noticed that by removing that, it made the water sound kind
  of weird. So to keep it sounding natural and, you know, like it fit in, what I
  ended up doing was I automated that bell curve to kind of slowly fade in, and
  then I automated it to slowly fade out when the bird was finished doing its
  business, right? And so that was what kept the recording sounding organic and
  natural, which is what I go for when I compose. So I have this one piece. It's
  called "Borsht," and the first section of it, my whole objective was to try to
  make one instrument sound diverse, like a variety of instruments, like an
  orchestra. What I used was a violin, and I was able to record it with
  different variations. It's a very versatile instrument, but to really take it
  to the next level, I used some EQ to make it sound like different instruments.
  So for example, there's a flute sound in the piece, and it's actually derived
  from the sound of a violin. I just played a high note, and to really, you
  know, really take it to the next level, I used EQ, and I boosted the high end
  and the low end a little bit, and that created this effect that sounded almost
  like a flute blowing, right? So combined with that high-pitched note, it
  created this amazing illusion. And what really, I think, makes it interesting
  is when I take sounds like that that are illusions, and then I actually slowly
  fade in the real version of the sound, and I think it creates this, you know,
  this space within the audience where it's like magic, and they're not really
  sure if what they're listening to is an actual flute, or is it a violin, or is
  it something synthetic? You know, it creates this really interesting middle
  ground, and it just makes me so excited as a composer, and these tools are
  just, EQ is great for doing stuff like that. So there's so many different
  plugins out there for when you're starting out. You don't need to go for an
  expensive EQ. In fact, I don't even use an expensive EQ in my work. Everything
  that I apply is very subtle, and so I can do everything that I need to do with
  just the built-in EQ plugins on my DAW. EQ is just a fantastic tool at any
  stage in your compositional career, and I definitely recommend learning about
  it and getting to know it if you're going to take this path.
