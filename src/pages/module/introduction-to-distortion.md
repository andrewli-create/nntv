  * Identify ways to avoid unwanted distortion such as clipping, which is often
  caused by a computer system being overloaded by an incoming signal.

  * Develop a basic understanding of harmonics information, and how a fundamental pitch has a series of overtones that are related to it. 

  * Recognize how distortion can be used with intention though sending an audio signal through various plugins such as a saturator, or compressor which can add additional harmonics that relate to the original signal on the frequency spectrum.

  Welcome to our quick guide to distortion! Let’s dive in!


  Strictly speaking, distortion is any alteration of an audio signal from its original form. In practice, however, “distortion” is typically used to refer to the “fuzzy” quality that a sound will have when its volume exceeds the limits of the system processing it.


  All sounds have fundamental frequencies which represent their main pitches, and overtones or harmonics, which stack on top to create the timbre of the sound you are hearing. Distorting a sound affects the balance of these frequencies, by amplifying harmonics and overtones which are already present, or by adding new ones.


  When you’re recording a sound that is too loud for the gain level on your audio interface, the upper and lower parts of the waveform will become flattened. This style of distortion is referred to as “clipping”.


  Distortion like this is very difficult to undo once a sound has been recorded, and as such, it is typically something audio engineers try their best to avoid. When used creatively, however, there are a world of possibilities. 


  Applied heavily, distortion will add bite and growl, and often increase its sustained. You’ve likely heard this before when listening to the sound of a distorted electric guitar. On the other hand, subtle distortion (also known as saturation) can be used to provide a slight boost to a sound, to give more presence to a sound, or to generate upper harmonics that make it easier to hear deep bass sounds on smaller speakers.  


  There are a wide range of tools which can be used to distort sounds within your DAW, including emulations of analog overdrive, fuzz, and tube units; and unique digital tools that combine multiple styles of distortion to give you even more complete control of your sound.


  In future videos, we will discuss even more ways that you can leverage these tools to add depth to your compositions.
