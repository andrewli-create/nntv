biography: "Duo Cichorium is comprised of interdisciplinary artists Jasmine Tsui
  and Louis Pino. Like the Chicory plant, the two performers are not native to
  Ontario, but have taken root in the environment of Toronto. Together, they
  strive to synthesize their aesthetic values with their artistic practices:
  playfulness, absurdity, and abstraction in conjunction with music performance,
  improvisation, integrated custom electronics, and visual art. The versatility
  of their practice spans from intimate chamber pieces to eye and ear straining
  multimedia works. Jaz and Pino have both received Masters degrees from the
  University of Toronto studying under Aiyun Huang, Beverley Johnston, and
  Charles Settle."
