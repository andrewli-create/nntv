  My name is Josh Weinfeld. I'm an audio engineer, video producer, and a
  composer. I work frequently with music technology to create works of my own
  and works for others.


  Stereo imaging is kind of a simple yet complex facet of music production. It involves everything from placing instruments and sounds in certain areas of the stereo field to creating complex textures and immersive experiences within the confines of stereo. Working within stereo essentially means you're working with two channels: a left and a right channel.


  I take two different approaches when working with the stereo field in my productions. One is a more realistic approach. A lot of my work involves acoustic recording, and in that way, I place different instruments in the stereo field using panning. For example, if I’m recording an ensemble, I might place a mallet instrument on the left side, hi-hats on the right, and a piano spanning the full width of the stereo field.


  When I work with acoustic sounds, I aim to maintain realism—to represent what actually happened in the recorded space. Imagine an orchestra: violins on the left, basses on the right or center, percussion in the middle rear, and cellos on the right. I use this layout to build the stereo image while mixing.


  In a more creative sense, especially in my electronic music, I use stereo imaging to create immersive experiences. This might not reflect what actually happened but instead focuses on what sounds interesting. In that space, there are no rules—only what sounds good to the artist and listener.


  One technique I enjoy is tricking the listener—taking a sound that starts on the far left of the mix and quickly jumps to the right. This can add rhythmic interest or create motion that supports the groove. A sound might bounce back and forth with the beat, moving from left to right in sync with eighth notes, creating a surprising and engaging effect.


  I think about stereo in multiple dimensions: left to right (lateral movement) and front to back (depth). In my electroacoustic work Twist for electronics and percussion quartet, there’s a duet between two vibraphones, panned hard left and hard right. They play short notes back and forth, and the stereo placement enhances the feeling of conversation between the two instruments. On headphones or stereo speakers, the listener hears a distinct left-right bounce that supports the musical interaction.


  In another track I produced with my duo partner, I used early reflections—what comes before reverb—to create a sense of front-to-back depth. There’s a drum fill that first feels far away and boxy, like it's happening in a small bathroom, then abruptly cuts to a dry, close-up version of the same fill. That contrast creates a strong impact. I use fast transitions like that often—stereo trickery that jolts the listener and keeps things engaging.


  When I’m designing sounds in production, I often like to start in mono. Stereo can sound wide and exciting—especially in headphones—but it’s easy to get carried away. Starting in mono helps me focus on the timbre and sonic detail of the sound before adding spatial elements. Once the core is solid, I expand it into stereo.


  You can find my production and music work on my company website, Continuous Motion Productions. I’m also part of a music production duo called VXRIABLE.
