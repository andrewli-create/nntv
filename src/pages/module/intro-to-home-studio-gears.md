  Develop an understanding of what each piece of equipment is and does, and why
  it is integral to a basic home studio setup


  * • Computer and how it relates to your DAW

  * • Audio interface

  * • Output device (monitors, headphones, etc)

  * • Microphone - XLR and USB

  * • MIDI controller

  * • Cables




  Put together a simple home studio setup, including the different pieces of equipment that you’ll need for what you want to accomplish (ie. a microphone if you want to record audio, or a MIDI controller to play directly in). Use, explore, and adjust this setup as you continue through the course.

  * Welcome to our Home Music Production Guide! In this video, we'll explore the
  essential gear you need to get started.

    First, you'll need a computer, the core of your music production setup for recording, composing, arranging, and mixing music. Make sure it meets your DAW’s requirements. Next, you’ll need an audio interface, a hardware device that connects microphones, instruments, and other audio equipment to your computer. Be sure to check its compatibility before you buy!

    To listen to the audio playback, you will need a pair of reliable studio monitors or headphones, or both. Invest in ones with accurate and flat frequency responses to ensure you can listen critically to your project playback.                         

    If you plan to record audio, you will need a microphone. XLR microphones will require a separate audio interface, while USB microphones will act as their own. You may want a MIDI controller if you want to play musical notes directly into your DAW. The most common controller is the keyboard. A 49-key MIDI keyboard is a good option for most basic tasks. Lastly, you’ll need cables to connect all your equipment, and any other necessary accessories.

    Be sure to check out our video on signal flow to learn about how all this gear gets wired up! Thanks for watching, and happy composing!
