title: Emma Della Rossa
bio: >-
  Emma Della Rossa is a versatile artist—singer, songwriter, flutist, and
  educator. She is inspired by exploring the deeper level of seemingly ordinary
  experiences and expressing them musically through a lens of honesty and truth.
  As a singer-songwriter, Emma’s original music combines influences from
  indie-pop and folk genres, tied together with layers of vocal harmonies and
  introspective lyricism. Emma’s live performances range from intimate acoustic
  sets to dynamic full-band arrangements.


  Inspired by the vibrant talents in Toronto, she launched her self-produced podcast, Bedroom Studios Podcast, featuring interviews with emerging artists and musicians. Driven by a passion for collaboration and conveying powerful messages through music, Emma released her debut original EP “Face The Music” in 2022. Her recent singles “Better” (2023), “Someone I Adore” (2024), and "Worse" (2025) mark a new thematic and artistic direction. Emma’s upcoming music releases in 2025 highlight her growing independence as a producer and her continued evolution as a songwriter and artist.
